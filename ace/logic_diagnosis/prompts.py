"""Prompt templates tailored for the logic diagnosis workflow."""

DECISION_MAKER_PROMPT = """
You are the diagnosis coordinator for a stuck-at fault localization task.

Use the playbook, reflections, and tester responses to decide which specialised
action should run next. Each action is executed by a dedicated generator prompt
that knows how to operate particular tooling (graph explorer, simulators,
pattern generators, matchers, or submission scripts).

Available actions:
{available_actions}

Playbook insights:
{playbook}

Recent reflections:
{reflection}

Diagnosis question:
{question}

Task context:
{context}

Respond with a JSON object that contains:
- reasoning: short rationale for the choice
- action: the identifier of the selected action
- objective: a concrete, tool-ready goal that the action generator must achieve
""".strip()

GRAPH_ACTION_PROMPT = """
You operate the graph analysis tooling for logic diagnosis. Use the netlist
graph database and the backconer utility to reason about structural cones,
fault propagation paths, and controllability/observability constraints.

Playbook knowledge:
{playbook}

Prior reflections:
{reflection}

Diagnosis question:
{question}

Context and objective:
{context}

When referencing the tooling, prefer concrete commands such as
`backconer --netlist <path> --output <primary_output>` or references to the
netlist CSV tables.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- reasoning: step-by-step reasoning referencing the inspected cones
- bullet_ids: list of playbook bullet identifiers you relied on
- final_answer: textual summary of the predicted fault and behaviour
- fault_prediction: an object with `fault_location` and `fault_behavior`
""".strip()

SIMULATION_ACTION_PROMPT = """
You control ganga together with the hope fault simulator. Use them to execute
faulty circuit simulations for the suspected SSL faults and capture complete
response traces.

Playbook knowledge:

Prior reflections:

Diagnosis question:
{question}

Context and objective:
{context}

Reference concrete invocations such as `ganga run --fault <id>` or
`hope --fault-list faults.txt --tests tests.atp`. Interpret simulation outputs
and map them to the tester response table.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- reasoning: describe how the simulations support the hypothesis
- bullet_ids: list of playbook bullet identifiers you relied on
- final_answer: textual summary of the predicted fault and behaviour
- fault_prediction: an object with `fault_location` and `fault_behavior`
""".strip()

TEST_GENERATION_ACTION_PROMPT = """
You manage Atalanta test pattern generation. Use it to craft distinguishing
patterns for the suspected stuck-at faults and explain how they constrain the
fault search space.

Playbook knowledge:

Prior reflections:

Diagnosis question:
{question}

Context and objective:
{context}

Reference commands such as `atalanta -f <fault> -ndet <n>` and note how the
produced patterns interact with the tester response CSV.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- reasoning: explain how the generated patterns isolate the fault
- bullet_ids: list of playbook bullet identifiers you relied on
- final_answer: textual summary of the predicted fault and behaviour
- fault_prediction: an object with `fault_location` and `fault_behavior`

MATCH_ACTION_PROMPT = """
You operate the matcher script that compares simulated responses against the
expected good circuit outputs. Highlight mismatching primary outputs and map
them back to the structural cone using backconer if needed.
