## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install ace-framework
```

### 2. Set Your API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# Or use Claude, Gemini, or 100+ other providers
```

### 3. Create Your First ACE Agent

```python
from ace import LiteLLMClient, Generator, Reflector, Curator, Playbook

# Initialize with any LLM
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4o-mini")
generator = Generator(client)
reflector = Reflector(client)
curator = Curator(client)
playbook = Playbook()

# Teach your agent through examples
# (See examples/ folder for complete training patterns)

# Now it can solve new problems with learned strategies
result = generator.generate(
    question="Give me the seahorse emoji",
    context="",
    playbook=playbook
)
print(result.final_answer)  # Agent applies learned strategies
```

That's it! Your agent is now learning and improving. 🎉

## Why Agentic Context Engine (ACE)?

AI agents make the same mistakes repeatedly.

ACE enables agents to learn from execution feedback: what works, what doesn't, and continuously improve. <br> No training data, no fine-tuning, just automatic improvement.

### Clear Benefits
- 📈 **20-35% Better Performance**: Proven improvements on complex tasks
- 🧠 **Self-Improving**: Agents get smarter with each task
- 🔄 **No Context Collapse**: Preserves valuable knowledge over time
- 🚀 **100+ LLM Providers**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more

## Demos

### 🌊 The Seahorse Emoji Challenge

A challenge where LLMs often hallucinate that a seahorse emoji exists (it doesn't).
Watch ACE learn from its own mistakes in real-time. This demo shows how ACE handles the infamous challenge!

![Kayba Test Demo](kayba_test_demo.gif)

In this example:
- **Round 1**: The agent incorrectly outputs 🐴 (horse emoji)
- **Self-Reflection**: ACE reflects without any external feedback
- **Round 2**: With learned strategies from ACE, the agent successfully realizes there is no seahorse emoji

Try it yourself:
```bash
python examples/kayba_ace_test.py
```

## How does Agentic Context Engine (ACE) work?

*Based on the [ACE research framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618) from Stanford & SambaNova.*

ACE uses three specialized roles that work together:
1. **🎯 Generator** - Executes tasks using learned strategies from the playbook
2. **🔍 Reflector** - Analyzes what worked and what didn't after each execution
3. **📝 Curator** - Updates the playbook with new strategies based on reflection

ACE teaches your agent and internalises:
- **✅ Successes** → Extract patterns that work
- **❌ Failures** → Learn what to avoid
- **🔧 Tool usage** → Discover which tools work best for which tasks
- **🎯 Edge cases** → Remember rare scenarios and how to handle them

The magic happens in the **Playbook**—a living document of strategies that evolves with experience. <br>
**Key innovation:** All learning happens **in context** through incremental updates—no fine-tuning, no training data, and complete transparency into what your agent learned.

## Logic diagnosis workflow

For hardware fault localization projects you can now use ACE's logic diagnosis mode:

- `ace.logic.LogicDiagnosisGenerator` splits generation into a decision maker that selects an action (`graph`, `simulation`, `generation`, `matching`, or `submission`) and an action-specific prompt that executes the chosen toolchain.
- `ace.logic.LogicDiagnosisEnvironment` compares the predicted stuck-at fault against ground-truth specs assuming a single stuck-at defect per task. Tester measurements can be loaded from JSON arrays where each element captures `input_patterns`, `good_outputs`, `faulty_outputs`, and `differences` for a pattern.
- See [`examples/logic_diagnosis.py`](examples/logic_diagnosis.py) for a complete offline training loop that routes tester responses through the new workflow.
- Configure `ace.logic.LogicDiagnosisGenerator(graph_mode=...)` to disable graph actions entirely (`"none"`), work with a pandas DataFrame representation (`"dataframe"`, the default), or traverse a NetworkX graph (`"networkx"`).

The generator accepts serialized tester responses via the `tester_responses` keyword argument so that the appropriate specialist prompt can access the latest measurements.

## Configuration

ACE works with any LLM provider through LiteLLM:

```python
# OpenAI
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4o")

# Anthropic Claude
client = LiteLLMClient(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")

# Google Gemini
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gemini-pro")

# Ollama (local)
client = LiteLLMClient(model="ollama/llama2")

# With fallbacks for reliability
client = LiteLLMClient(
    model="gpt-4",
    fallbacks=["claude-3-haiku", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
)
```
