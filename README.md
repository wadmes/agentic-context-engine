🧠 **ACE** is a framework for building AI agents that get smarter over time by learning from their mistakes and successes.

💡 Based on the paper "Agentic Context Engineering" from Stanford/SambaNova - ACE helps your LLM agents build a "playbook" of strategies that improves with each task.

🔌 **Works with any LLM** - OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and 100+ more providers out of the box!

📦 [PyPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/ace-framework/) | 📚 [Documentation](https://github.com/Kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/wiki) | 🐛 [Issues](https://github.com/Kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/issues) | 💬 [Discussions](https://github.com/Kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/discussions)

## Quick Start

**Minimum Python 3.9 required**

### Install ACE:
```bash
# Basic installation
pip install ace-framework

# With LangChain support (for advanced routing & chains)
pip install ace-framework[langchain]

# For development
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up your API key:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your OpenAI key (or Anthropic, Google, etc.)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
```

### Run your first agent:
```python
from ace import LiteLLMClient, OfflineAdapter, Generator, Reflector, Curator
from ace import Playbook, Sample, TaskEnvironment, EnvironmentResult
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Create your agent with any LLM
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")  # or claude-3, gemini-pro, etc.

# Set up ACE components
adapter = OfflineAdapter(
    playbook=Playbook(),
    generator=Generator(client),
    reflector=Reflector(client),
    curator=Curator(client)
)

# Define a simple task
class SimpleEnv(TaskEnvironment):
    def evaluate(self, sample, output):
        correct = sample.ground_truth.lower() in output.final_answer.lower()
        return EnvironmentResult(
            feedback="Correct!" if correct else "Try again",
            ground_truth=sample.ground_truth
        )

# Train your agent
samples = [
    Sample(question="What is 2+2?", ground_truth="4"),
    Sample(question="Capital of France?", ground_truth="Paris"),
]

results = adapter.run(samples, SimpleEnv(), epochs=1)
print(f"Agent learned {len(adapter.playbook.bullets())} strategies!")
```

## How It Works

ACE uses three AI "roles" that work together to help your agent improve:

1. **🎯 Generator** - Tries to solve tasks using the current playbook
2. **🔍 Reflector** - Analyzes what went wrong (or right)
3. **📝 Curator** - Updates the playbook with new strategies

Think of it like a sports team reviewing game footage to get better!

## Examples

### Simple Q&A Agent
```python
python examples/simple_ace_example.py
```

### Advanced Examples with Different LLMs
```python
python examples/quickstart_litellm.py
```

### LangChain Integration (Advanced)
```python
# With routing and load balancing
python examples/langchain_example.py
```

### Save and Load Playbooks
```python
# Save a trained playbook for later use
adapter = OfflineAdapter(...)
results = adapter.run(samples, environment, epochs=3)
adapter.playbook.save_to_file("my_trained_playbook.json")

# Load a pre-trained playbook
from ace import Playbook, OnlineAdapter
playbook = Playbook.load_from_file("my_trained_playbook.json")
adapter = OnlineAdapter(playbook=playbook, ...)
```

Check out `examples/playbook_persistence.py` for a complete example!

## Supported LLM Providers

ACE works with **100+ LLM providers** through LiteLLM:

- **OpenAI** - GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Anthropic** - Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **Google** - Gemini Pro, PaLM
- **Cohere** - Command models
- **Local Models** - Ollama, Transformers
- **And many more!**

Just change the model name:
```python
# OpenAI
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4")

# Anthropic Claude
client = LiteLLMClient(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")

# Google Gemini
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gemini-pro")

# With fallbacks for reliability
client = LiteLLMClient(
    model="gpt-4",
    fallbacks=["claude-3-haiku", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
)
```

## Key Features

- ✅ **Self-Improving** - Agents learn from experience and build knowledge
- ✅ **Provider Agnostic** - Switch LLMs with one line of code
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Automatic retries, fallbacks, and error handling
- ✅ **Cost Efficient** - Track costs and use cheaper models as fallbacks
- ✅ **Async Support** - Built for high-performance applications
- ✅ **Fully Typed** - Great IDE support and type safety

## Advanced Usage

### Online Learning (Learn While Running)
```python
from ace import OnlineAdapter

# Agent improves while processing real tasks
adapter = OnlineAdapter(
    playbook=existing_playbook,  # Can start with existing knowledge
    generator=Generator(client),
    reflector=Reflector(client),
    curator=Curator(client)
)

# Process tasks one by one, learning from each
for task in real_world_tasks:
    result = adapter.process(task, environment)
    # Agent automatically updates its strategies
```

### Custom Task Environments
```python
class CodeTestingEnv(TaskEnvironment):
    def evaluate(self, sample, output):
        # Run the generated code
        test_passed = run_tests(output.final_answer)

        return EnvironmentResult(
            feedback=f"Tests {'passed' if test_passed else 'failed'}",
            ground_truth=sample.ground_truth,
            metrics={"pass_rate": 1.0 if test_passed else 0.0}
        )
```

### Streaming Responses
```python
# Get responses token by token
for chunk in client.complete_with_stream("Write a story"):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

### Async Operations
```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    response = await client.acomplete("Solve this problem...")
    print(response.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Architecture

ACE implements the Agentic Context Engineering method from the research paper:

- **Playbook**: A structured memory that stores successful strategies
- **Bullets**: Individual strategies with helpful/harmful counters
- **Delta Operations**: Incremental updates that preserve knowledge
- **Three Roles**: Generator, Reflector, and Curator working together

The framework prevents "context collapse" - a common problem where agents forget important information over time.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem**: `pip install ace-framework` fails
- **Solution**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed: `python --version`
- **Solution**: Upgrade pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

**Problem**: ImportError when using LangChain integration
- **Solution**: Install with extras: `pip install ace-framework[langchain]`

**Problem**: LiteLLM API errors
- **Solution**: Check your API keys are set correctly in `.env`
- **Solution**: Verify your API key has sufficient credits/quota

### Common Errors

**"Unrecognized request argument"**: The LLM provider doesn't support a parameter
- This is usually handled automatically, but if it persists, please report an issue

**Memory issues with large playbooks**:
- Use online adaptation mode instead of offline
- Periodically save and reload playbooks

**Rate limiting errors**:
- Add delays between requests
- Use exponential backoff (built into LiteLLM)
